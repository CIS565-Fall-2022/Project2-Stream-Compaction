* Tested on: Windows 11, i7-12700H @ 2.30GHz 32GB, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Ti

## Introduction

In this project, I implemented the following algorithms on the GPU and tested them:

1. Exclusive Scan (CPU, Naive Scan, Work-Efficient Scan, Thrust Scan) - given an array A, output another array B such that each element b\[i\]
is a sum of a\[0\] + ... + a\[i - 1\] excluding itself.
2. Stream Compaction - given an array A, output another array B that only contains elements from A which match a criteria.

## Implementation and Results
#### Scan 1. Sequential CPU Scan 
#### Scan 2. Naive GPU Scan
#### Scan 3. Work-Efficient GPU Scan
#### Scan 4. Thrust Scan
#### Stream Compaction
