Tested on AORUS 15P XD laptop with specs:  
- Windows 11 22000.856  
- 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11800H @ 2.30GHz 2.30 GHz  
- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Laptop GPU  

I implemented the following parallel algorithms on the GPU and benchmarked them against my own CPU implementations and Thrust on the GPU:  
- Scan
- Stream compaction
- Radix sort
